Inside this file you will find the initialization of the domain and all the definitions of the boundary and initial conditions for the 2D case.
Since we are dealing with a 2D problem, 
we will have 4 boundary conditions for our surface, which is modeled as a square with sides of length 1:

    |> X = 0 left  side (Dirichlet)
    |> X = 1 right side (Neumann)

    |> Y = 0 lower side (Neumann)
